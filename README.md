In this course, I'll start by learning the basics of the Dart programming language and how to write efficient and clean code. I'll then move on to Git, where I'll learn how to manage my code, collaborate with others, and contribute to open source projects.

Throughout the course, I'll work on practical exercises and projects that will help me put my new skills into practice. I'll also learn how to use Git effectively with Dart projects, including creating branches, merging changes, and resolving conflicts.

By the end of the course, I'll have a strong foundation in Dart programming and Git version control, which will enable me to confidently build and manage my own projects. So, join me on this exciting journey to become a Dart and Git expert!
